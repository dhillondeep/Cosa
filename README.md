# WCosa

WCosa is a direct fork from Cosa project which aims to replace Arduino core with an OOP style core. WCosa uses Cosa and wraps a create, build and upload system around it to make it a complete solution for users. This is being developed by embedded team members at [Waterloop](https://teamwaterloop.ca). Waterloop will use this build system to program AVR boards on their pod.
